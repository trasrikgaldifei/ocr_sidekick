	In the following lines you can define tags, which will be added to the documents keywords and are used for file naming.
	The syntax is:
	array_push($tags, array("SEARCHTYPE", array("TAGNAME - optional", "SEARCHTERM1", "SEARCHTERM2", ...));
	SEARCHTYPE	1 is a standard search
				2 is a regex search (in this case the found value will be used as TAGNAME)
	TAGNAME		is the tag, which will be added, if the search is successful
	SEARCHTERMx	is the value, for which the search is performed. If multiple values are given, theyre connected with OR
	
	In addition, subdirectories within the consumer directory are treated as tags for the files contained in them.
